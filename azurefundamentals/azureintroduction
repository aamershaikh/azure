        What is cloud computing ?
        - Ability to rent computing resources on demand.
        - delivery of computing services such as storage , databases, networking, software, analytics and intellignence over the internet.
        - helps reduce operating costs and scale as needed.

        What is computing resources?
        - Windows and Linux servers
        - Unlimited storage
        - Databases
        - Queues
        - Content Delivery network
        - Batch Processing Jobs
        - Big Data - Hadoop
        - Media services
        - Machine learning
        - Chat bots
        - Cognitive services
        etc 1000+ services


***Chapter 1 : Describe cloud concepts***

- Benefits of cloud computing
    - Cost savings - both real and accounting
    - Agility
    - availability
    - security
    - global reach
    - range of ready on demand services
    - range of tools


    * cost saving
    - total cost of ownership - less expense on electricity, cooling etc
    - other ways to save costs - autoscaling
    - Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on site data centers, server racks etc

    * global reach
    - data centers in multiple countries

    * availability/performance
    - expressed in % - 4 9s, 5 9s
    - ergularly upgraded hardware for fast and efficient computing

    * security
    - broad set of policies and technologies that provide security for data, apps and infrastructure

    * scalability
    - ability to handle growth of users / work

    * elasticity
    - ability of a system to grow and shrink based on application demand
    - usually automated - hence minimal effect on runtime.

    * agility
    - ability to change rapidly based on changes to the market or environment
    - add more capacity to production environment

    * disaster recovery
    - ability of a system to recover from failure within a period of time and how much data is lost
    - data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on cloud provider network


    * capital expenditure (Capex) and Operational expenditure (OpEx) benefits - Accounting
    - Capex is money invested in assets (like computers) that return investment over time.
    - Opex is the money spent every day on operating expenses.
    - Consumption based model in Cloud computing
        - in opex model we - pay by the minute
                           - pay by the hour
                           - pay per execution



*** Catagories of cloud serves (paradigm) ****

1) Infrastructure as a service (IAAS)
    - virtual machines, networking, load balancer, firewalls
    - does not include software services like databases

2) Platform as a service (PaaS)
    - upload the code packages and have them to run without access to hardware (WebApps, AppServices etc)

3) Software as a service (SaaS)
    - eg : Dropbox, backup services, google drive, google docs, Active directory
    - Having access to products on the cloud

**** Shared responsibility model **** - Refer diagram in chapter 8

4) Serverless
    - There are still servers....you just dont ever have to deal with them.
    - even less access to server than PaaS.
    - even with PaaS you have to choose an app service plan
    - with PaaS scaling us your responsibility, in serverless, it is upto the cloud provider to autoscale
    - basically serverless means not worrying about choosing scaling
    - chances of paying 0$ if service is not used. Because we pay for execution in serverless. In appservice, we pay by the hour.
    - Azure serverless offers
        - azure functions
        - serverless kubernetes
        - SQL database serverless
        - cosmos DB serverless


****Types of cloud computing********
1) public cloud
    - azure owns the hardware on their network and infrastructure

2) private cloud
    - looks and acts like a cloud except customer owns or leases or has exclusive access to hardware . Eg ; Financial services companies prefer their own cloud.

3) Hybrid cloud
    - combination of public and private clouds, scale private infrastructure to the cloud.

*** principle of economies at scale - the more of something you bit the cheaper it is to own and operate per unit.****



*****Describe core azure services********

Section 1 : Core azure architectural components

        *) Regions - 60+ regions - not all accessible by everyone. Eg : china

        *) region Pairs - backup concept
            - each region has one other reqion whih is treated as its pair
            - almost always in the same geography - data storage laws
            - the data connection between region pairs is the highest speed available
            - software rollouts are deployed to one region of a pat and the other is not touched
            - if multiple reqions go down, one region of each pair is treated as a priority

        *) Availibility zones
            - one region has multiple AZones - each AZone has its own hardware, cooling etc.

        *) Resource Groups
            - Similar to folder strcuture
            - Management goups
                - subscriptions
                    - resource groups
                        - resources

        *) Azure subscription
            - subscription is a billing unit
            - users have access to one or more subscriptions with different roles
            - all resoures consumed by a subscription will be billed to the owner
            - can be used to organize resources into completely distinct accounts

        *) Management groups
            -     we can manage governance models over a subscription using managment groups. eg : policies



 - Azure resource manager (ARM)
    -  This is how azure interacts with resources behind the scenes
    - through Portal or command line or Visual code etc
    - anything we do happens throgh azure resource manager API.
    Azure resources - instance of service that you create that are yours to use
