*****Describe core azure services********

Section 1 : Core azure architectural components

        *) Regions - 60+ regions - not all accessible by everyone. Eg : china
        - defination : a set of data center within a letency defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low latency network

        *) region Pairs - backup concept
            - each region has one other reqion whih is treated as its pair
            - almost always in the same geography - data storage laws
            - the data connection between region pairs is the highest speed available
            - software rollouts are deployed to one region of a part and the other is not touched
            - if multiple reqions go down, one region of each pair is treated as a priority

        *) Availibility zones
            - one region has multiple AZones - each AZone has its own hardware, cooling etc.
            - unique physical location within a region. each Azone is made up of one or more data centers equipped with independant power cooling and networking.

        *) Resource Groups
            - Similar to folder strcuture
            - Management goups
                - subscriptions
                    - resource groups
                        - resources
            - imporant points to consider for resource groups :
                    - all resources in a RG should share the same lifecycle. deploy, update and delete them together.
                    - one resource can exists in one RG
                    - add/remove resource in RG anytime
                    - move RG from one to another
                    - resource in RG can be located in different regions than the resource group
                    - resource group can be used to scope access control for administrative actions. we can assign azure policies, roles and resource locks.
                    - you can deploy upto 800 instances of a resource types in each resource group
                    - some resources can exists outside of resource group. these resources are deployed to subscrition, management, group or tenant. Only a specific types are supported at these scopes.
                    - RG can be created via portal CLI or ARM template

        *) Azure subscription
            - subscription is a billing unit
            - users have access to one or more subscriptions with different roles
            - all resoures consumed by a subscription will be billed to the owner
            - can be used to organize resources into completely distinct accounts

        *) Management groups
            -     we can manage governance models over a subscription using managment groups. eg : policies



 - Azure resource manager (ARM) - Defination  : its the deployment and management service for azure.
    - provides a management layer that enables to create, update and delete resources in azure account.
    - we can use management features like access control , locks, tags to secure and organize resources after deployment.
    - This is how azure interacts with resources behind the scenes
    - Tool to use for ARM : through Portal or command line or Visual code etc
    - anything we do happens throgh azure resource manager API.
    - benefits of using Azure resource manager
            - manage infrstructure through declarative templates rather than scripts
            - deploy and manage and monitor all the resource sof your solution as a group rather than handling them indiviually
            - deploy the solution throughout the development lifecycle and have confidence that resources are deployed in a consistent state.
            - define dependancies between resources so they are deployed in correct order
            - apply rbac to all services natively via managment platform
            - apply tags to organize resources
            - clarify the organization billing by viewing costs
    Azure resources - Defination : instance of service that you create that are yours to use
