***Describe cloud concepts***

- Benefits of cloud computing
    - Cost savings - both real and accounting
    - Agility
    - availability
    - security
    - global reach
    - range of ready on demand services
    - range of tools


    * cost saving
    - total cost of ownership - less expense on electricity, cooling etc
    - other ways to save costs - autoscaling

    * global reach
    - data centers in multiple countries

    * availability
    - expressed in % - 4 9s, 5 9s

    * scalability
    - ability to handle growth of users / work

    * elasticity
    - ability of a system to grow and shrink based on application demand

    * agility
    - ability to change rapidly based on changes to the market or environment
    - add more capacity to production environment

    * disaster recovery
    - ability of a system to recover from failure within a period of time and how much data is lost


    * capital expenditure (Capex) and Operational expenditure (Op Ex) benefits - Accounting
    - Capex is money invested in assets (like computers) that return investment over time.
    - Opex is the money spent every day on operating expenses.
    - Consumption based model in Cloud computing
        - in opex model we - pay by the minute
                           - pay by the hour
                           - pay per execution
