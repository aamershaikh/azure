Azure security tools
    - security features
        - Azure security center
                - unified infrastructure security management system that monitors and protects your systems inside and outside azure
                - strenthen security
                - protect against threats
                - get secure faster
                
        - key vault
                - central secure repository for your secrets , certificates and keys
                
        - azure sentinel - 
                - centralizes all the log files from various resources
                - analyses them to detect threats - eg someone giving wrong password continously
                - allows you to run queries on those logs yourself
                - investigate the incident
                - orchestration and automation to fix these issues
                
        - azure dedicated hosts
                - hardware that is dedicated to u
                - you can reserve a machine and run multiple vurtual machines on it
  
 Concepts : defense in depth (bottom up)
                    - having securoty layers
                        - data sec - virtual network endpoint
                        - application sec - api management
                        - compute - limit remote desktop access, windows updates
                        - network - NSG, use of subnets, deny by default
                        - perimeter - DDOS, firewalls
                        - identity and access - Azure AD
                        - phsical - doorlocks, access cards
